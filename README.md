# Global-Motion-Estimation

In this assignment we have assed Various evaluation metrics of information content of image motion sequence and also studied and implemented Global motion estimation in different video sequences. Some of the evaluation metrics which were employed to measure the quality of the information content are MSE (mean square error), PSNR(peak signal to noise ratio) and entropy. In the second part, for implementing the Global motion estimation (GME), first the optical flows are calculated using open cv. Then GME is implemented using those retrieved optical flows. The code is tested on all videos on the CREMI servers.
